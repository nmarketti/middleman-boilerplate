Initial directions.
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `npm update`
- Run `middleman server`

This will install Middleman, Livereload, Webpack, and several JS components such as jQuery, GSAP, ScrollMagic, Bootstrap 4 beta, and mobile-detect. While jQuery is included, it will be eventually removed from this starter pack in favor of other libraries available. 

For S3_Website and linking to CircleCI, you will need proper IAM credentials to establsih the buckets and hooks for CircleCI. This is also in the process of being automated into team environments along with linking to Route53 for Staging and Production deployments.

Until then, reach out to me (Conrad) and I'll link things up for you.
